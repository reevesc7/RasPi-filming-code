# Raspberry Pi Filming Code

This repository contains a set of scripts which enable quick setup of a simple, remote-controlled recording setup via a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. A controlling computer connects to the Raspberry Pi and initiates recording for a predetermined interval, set by users during installation and/or post-installation editing.

These sripts manage installation and operation of the filming script, written in Python, while remote access is achieved via secure shell (ssh) connection. Tutorials for setting up filming scripts and easy ssh connection, and using the final setup can be found on the **[Wiki](https://github.com/reevesc7/RasPi-filming-code/wiki)**.

This code was originally developed for use in behavioral neuroscience experiments to capture video footage of animal behavior. Footage of this type can subsequently be analyzed using programs like DeepLabCut or SLEAP to extract animal positions from each frame. This process, as well as the installation and use of this code, is documented in the following paper, pending publication:
